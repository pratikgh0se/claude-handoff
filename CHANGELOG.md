# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-20

Extracted from machine-setup v1.0.0 (the Bento handoff system, spec features F35 to F37).

- PreCompact hook `precompact-handoff.py` and SessionStart hook `postcompact-inject.py` copied unchanged.
- New `handoff-nudge.py` (PostToolUse): built-in handoff nudge at 75% of the window, then every 50k tokens, with the same text and meta file as the Bento compact plugin.
- `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`: idempotent settings merge, backups, dry-run.
- `tests/smoke.sh`: install, hooks, nudge, uninstall in a temporary HOME.
